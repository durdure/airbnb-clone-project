### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A user-friendly design in a booking system is crucial for several reasons:
- **Enhanced User Experience:** A well-designed interface makes it easier for users to navigate, find properties, and complete bookings without frustration.
- **Increased Conversion Rates:** Simplifying the booking process can lead to higher conversion rates, as users are less likely to abandon their carts when the process is intuitive.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** A positive user experience fosters customer loyalty and encourages repeat bookings, as users are more likely to return to a platform that they find easy and enjoyable to use.
- **Accessibility:** A user-friendly design ensures that the platform is accessible to a wider audience, including those with disabilities.
